    <p>Online food ordering is the process of ordering food from a website or other application. The product can be
        either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a ghost kitchen) or food that has
        not been specially prepared for direction consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits,
        frozen meats. etc).

        The first online food order was a pizza from Pizza Hut in 1994.


        This is a picture from a 2018 Pizza Hut pizza box, which describes the first online food sale.
        The online food ordering market has increased in the U.S with 40 percent of U.S adults having ordered their
        food online once. The online food ordering market includes foods prepared by restaurants, prepared by
        independent people, and groceries being ordered online and then picked up or delivered.

        The first online food ordering service, World Wide Waiter (now known as Waiter.com), was founded in 1995.
        The site originally serviced only northern California, later expanding to several additional cities in the
        United States.

        By the late 2000s, major pizza chains had created their own mobile applications and started doing 20â€“30
        percent of their business online. With increased smartphone penetration, and the growth of both Uber and the
        sharing economy, food delivery startups started to receive more attention. In 2010, Snapfinger, who is a
        multi-restaurant ordering website, had a growth in their mobile food orders by 17 percent in one year.

        By 2015, online ordering began overtaking phone ordering.

        In 2015, China's online food ordering and delivery market grew from 0.15 billion yuan to 44.25 billion yuan.

        As of September 2016, online delivery accounted for about 3 percent of the 61 billion U.S. restaurant
        transactions.
